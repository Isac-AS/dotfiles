# Installing audio
The audio installation was done using pipewire. There was no need to do additional configurations, just install the following packages:
```bash
sudo pacman -S pipewire
sudo pacman -S wireplumber
sudo pacman -S pipewire-audio
sudo pacman -S pipewire-alsa
sudo pacman -S pipewire-pulse
sudo pacman -S pipewire-jack
sudo pacman -S pavucontrol
```

Worked well.
